# Static Array Implementation

## Description

Implement a `StaticArray` class that provides basic operations for a fixed-size array. The array has a fixed capacity (memory allocated) and maintains the current length (number of elements actually stored).

Your implementation should support the following operations:

- **Insert at end**: Add an element to the next available position at the end of the array
- **Remove from end**: Remove the last element from the array
- **Insert at index**: Insert an element at a specific index, shifting existing elements to the right
- **Remove from index**: Remove an element from a specific index, shifting existing elements to the left
- **Get at index**: Get the value stored at a specific index
- **Set at index**: Set some value at a specific index
- **Print Array**: Display the current elements in the array
